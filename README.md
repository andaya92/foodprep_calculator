# Developed for Personal Use.

# Calculator to aid in grocery shopping. Uses meal objects so it can be somewhat flexible.
## I built this to assist in figuring out how much food to buy depening on the amount of orders I recieved that week. (I was running a food prepping service as a personal trainer.)


### Check the boxes according to meal and enter number of meals
#### Press calculate and the amount of raw ingredients needed are displayed.
#### Units are grams or bundles. Such as 0.24 of a bundle of spinach or 580g
